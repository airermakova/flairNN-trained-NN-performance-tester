This repository contains python script to estimate performance of flair NN, trained to recognize user identity.
And python script to prepare training sets for ner recognition.

To estimate flairNN performance:
To use do following steps: 

1. Prepare text in .txt format
2. Save is in utf-8 format 
3. Copy file UsersList.txt into same folder with python script#
4. Start python script from console with command python FlaiNNTest.py <yourTextFile>

To prepare flairNN training sets:
To use do following steps: 

1. Prepare text in .txt format
2. Save is in utf-8 format 
3. Copy file UsersList.txt into same folder with python script#
4. Start python script from console with command python prepareTestSets.py or prepareTestSetsComplexUsers.py or prepareTestSetsComplexUsersNoRepeat.py or prepareTestSetsComplexUsers1.py <yourTextFile>

prepareTestSetsComplexUsers1.py script at the end of training set preparation will create statistics file with all users found in source file. It will be written in 
"onlyDetectedUsers.txt" file

There is also script to use trained NN to mark users.
It will execute following steps:
 - mark users from phrases from entrance file
 - create 3 files, 
 file with marked phrases "markedPhrases.txt", 
 file with phrases where users identities defined with 1 word only "markedSimpleUsersOnly.txt", 
 file with phrases where users identities marked with several words "markedComplexUsersOnly.txt".
 
To see all users marked by trained NN do following steps: 
python demoForNN.py <your text file> <number of ohrases to read>


To prepare improve flairNN performance for complex users :
Do following steps: 

1. Prepare text in .txt format
2. Save is in utf-8 format 
3. Copy trained model in file path <your script>/trainer/final-model.pt
4. Start python script from console with command python FlairNNCorection.py <yourTextFile> <number of ohrases to read>

To estimate how many users was added into train set do following steps:
1. Make sure after preparation of training set you got file onlyDetectedUsersNR.txt. If file with user statistic have different name, rename it into onlyDetectedUsersNR.txt
2. Start python script from console with command python foundUsersStat.py
All complex users will be written into file onlyDetectedComplexUsersNRStat.txt. 
All simple users will be written into file onlyDetectedSimpleUsersNRStat
